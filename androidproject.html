	<h1>Written Response</h1>
Cody and I based the MeteorPop game off of a project we have done in the past, which is Balloon Pop except that it deals with Meteors and the orientation is in horizontal. Cody and I had two problems, which is that after the player taps a meteor and it goes to its explosion image, the explosion stops for a while and falls in its explosion state (it didn’t even go up to the top, too!). The other problem I faced (Cody’s is the transferring of code from Screen1 to the Game screen) is how to change the meteor’s hitbox, since if the hitbox of the meteor remained the way it was, then game over would have been pretty quick. Cody and I fixed the first problem after consulting with Mr. Landfried and finding out that the explosiontimer.set enabled:true was placed in the wrong area, thus letting the meteors turn into explosions while staying still for a while and falling. Also, Cody and I changed the timer for the explosiontimer from 3 seconds to 1. For the second problem, I solved it independently using Pixlr Editor’s constraint tool, which acted like a crop tool, to reduce the ‘hitbox’, which surprisingly worked.

	<h1>Video Transcript</h1>
	Hello, to whoever is viewing this video. This is MeteorPop, a game made with Cody Schieferstine. The game starts with the branding screen, which is “appropriated” from the game Earth Defense Force. Then we are taken to the main menu, with three buttons named, in order,. “Play Game,” “Story,” and “About.” Tapping on About will lead us to a screen with two buttons labeled “About” and “Back to Menu.” Clicking on the About button will show a notifier stating the game’s creators, Ramon Bersamin and Cody Schieferstine. Now we go back to the Main Menu and view the story. Now that we have viewed every button on the Main Menu except the Play Game button, let’s play the game! After the screen is loaded, the player is faced with four meteors falling at different speeds. The goal is not to let the meteors touch the ground or else the player is shown the game over page with a button that goes back to the Main Menu.
