    <h1> THE WRITTEN RESPONSE </h1>
    <p>The difficulties my partner and I encountered during the coding was when we hit a snag on the randomized questions. The first problem was hard; if the questions are randomized, then how will we get to match the answers to the randomized question? I solved this problem independently by asking a classmate who had the same idea as us how they did it. It turns out that you assign each question to a variable (for us it was q1) and make a list. I then added a list with numbers from 1-10, corresponding to the questions I have. Then, I added a variable that chooses a random question through random.shuffle(questionlist). Finally, I add the if statements that state that if the number acquired by random.shuffle matches with the question specified by my if statement, it prints that question along with the answers.</p>
    <p>The second difficulty that I solved with my partner would be on deciding what questions we had to use. This problem was quite simple, as all we did is ask the groups who have the same idea as us and what subject their quiz would be.</p>

    <h1>THE VIDEO TRANSCRIPT</h1>
    <p>This is the project me and my partner created. It is a simple quiz on random trivia. As you can see, the two decisions at this point are Go/Close. Go starts the game, and Close ends the game. While I tinker around a bit with the response, you can see the sarcastic replies I added in. Now, as I type in Go, I'm presented with a question. Since I made the quiz, it's obvious that I know all the answers. Then, I type in a wrong answer on purpose, just to show what happens. Lastly, I finish the final question, and the game ends.</p>
