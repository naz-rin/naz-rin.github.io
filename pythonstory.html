				<h1>The Video Transcript</h1>
		<p>Hello, my name is Ramon and I'll be showing off a project that I collaborated with Qayz Nurani: a story made from Python. Now, as I click 'Run', the right side shows how the code on the left appears. First off, I'll mess with the commands for a bit and take a look at what the game has to say. Oh wow! My first 'Bad End'! Isn't that quite ominous? And then we reach the end. It's quite short compared to the others, is it not?</p>	
	
				<h1>The Written Response</h1>
		<p> While the Python project was easy to make, Qayz and I did run into some problems. The first problem we solved was the story not running when Beb decides to bomb the trio. Qayz and I solved it together by combing through the code and finding out that the answer needed and the key needed to be typed in was different, so we resolved the problem by making it the same. A problem I solved independently would be the story not being accessible to me. I resolved it by asking Qayz to fork the story to me so I could continue working on it when Qayz is absent.</p>

Just recently, the God Emperor announced that he would relinquish his rule to anybody that managed to reach his armed fortress, claiming that “Nobody builds fortresses better than me.” Jush took up the gauntlet, going up against the people who also want to become the ruler of Umerica, Killary Hlinton, also known as the 
		Hider of Mails; Rarco Mubio, the Goblin of the Guac; and Ced Truz, the Killer of the Zodiac. Along with the Slow and Steady, Jush defeats the three and then reaches the fortress of Drump. After a series of choices, Jush eventually wins the right to rule Umerica and Drump had his skin turn into an orange color.  </p>
